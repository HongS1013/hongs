#### Teacher-Facing Learning Analytics Dashboard for Social Annotation

##### Introduction 
The synergy of learning design, teacher inquiry, and learning analytics has a positive impact on instructors as designers and practitioners as well as the learning of students, i.e., the ​​learning design should lay the fundamental basis for the inquiry of teachers (Nancy, 2017), and the inquiry guides the adoption of learning analytics (see Figure 1). However, the synergistic effect has been hindered due to the misalignments: 1) lack of a learning design framework to direct inquiry - the misalignment between learning design and teacher inquiry, and 2) the data provided by the learning analytics cannot answer the questions of teachers - the misalignment between teacher inquiry and learning analytics (Macfadyen et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2020). The disconnection was also revealed by the systematic review of Mangaroska and Giannakos (2018). One major problem this research intends to address is the misalignment between learning design, teacher inquiry, and learning analytics in the expectation that learning analytics could be truly useful for teachers to reflect and improve learning design in authentic educational settings. <br /><br />

##### The Study 
Attempting to address the issue, this study aims to design and implement a learning analytics dashboard with and for teachers using Activity-centered Analysis and Design framework (Goodyear & Carvalho, 2014) to support teacher inquiry into the learning process of students in social annotation activity. Using the design-based research approach, the study, focusing on the first cycle, includes two main phases: the design and implementation phase. <br />

<b> Design - from October 2022 to June 2023 </b> <br />
Under the general guidance of ACAD, we collaborated with instructors from different colleges in the University of Minnesota via three-round meetings and multiple emails to design and develop a functional dashboard. The developed dashboard has a design page and an analytics page. <span style="color: red"> On the design page </span>, instructors input their design of social annotation activities (see Figure 2). Taking the learning design as a baseline/reference, the difference between student activity imagined by the instructor and the student activity in real-time class could be easily seen <span style="color: blue"> on the analytic page </span> (see Figure 3). Instructors can take down memos of reflection on the dashboard while viewing the data. <br />

<b> Implemenation - from September 2023 to December 2023 </b> <br />
In the fall semester of 2024, three instructors used the dashboard in their classes. We found that by visualizing the analytics results, the dashboard supported teachers to understand students' interaction patterns and engagement in social annotation, providing actionable insights into the learning design and teaching practice. Informed by the dashboard, teachers grasped the enactment of the designed participation roles, identified students who did not participate, and filtered out students' confusions and heated discussion topics. Teachers enacted on the analytics by explaining the roles, reaching out to the absent students, and facilitating in class discussions. <br /> <br />
